# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

Customer churn, or attrition, occurs when a customer discontinues their relationship with a company. In a competitive business environment, retaining customers is essential for long-term success. Predicting churn helps organizations take proactive steps to retain customers and minimize revenue loss. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic, account, and service-related data.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that predicts customer churn. By analyzing demographic data (such as gender, senior citizen status, and tenure), as well as service-related information (such as internet, phone service, and online security), we aim to identify customers at high risk of churning. With these predictions, companies can implement retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce financial losses.

## 🚀 Features

* Predict customer churn based on demographic and service-related data.
* Classify customers at high risk of churn.
* Help design effective retention strategies to reduce churn rates.
